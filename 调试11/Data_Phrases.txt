this_work proposes an improvement of gold_nanoparticle sensors using mixed - ligand shells composed of ligands with a shared affinity . As a proof of concept , two ligands , 2-Sulfanylethanesulfonate ( MSA ) and 11-mercaptoundecanoic_acid ( MUA ) , sharing an affinity_towards Ba2+ were chosen . the two ligands were then combined in a mixed ligand shell , and the Ba2+ sensor properties of both the mixed - ligand and mono-ligand shell nanoparticles were examined . the sensor properties of the mixed - ligand nanoparticles were then shown to be superior to both mono-ligand particles . the mixed - ligand nanoparticles retained a high sensitivity for Ba2+ , while greatly improving the sensor linear range and selectivity . next , nanoparticles stabilized by a mixed - ligand monolayer consisting of either MSA or MUA with a ligand unreactive towards Ba2+ were shown to have no reactivity_towards Ba2+ . this result indicates a cooperative effect between the MSA and MUA ligands and highlights the importance of the reactivity of both ligands for sensor optimization . carbon_monoxide has_been recognized relatively recently as signaling molecule , and only very few dedicated natural CO sensor proteins have_been identified so_far . these include in particular heme - based transcription_factors : the bacterial sensor proteins CooA and RcoM . In these 6-coordinated systems , exchange between an internal protein residue and CO as a heme ligand in the sensor domain affects the properties of the DNA - binding domain . using light to dissociate heme - ligand bonds can in principle initiate this switching process . we review the efforts to use this method to investigate early processes in ligand switching and signaling , with an emphasis on the CO- trapping ? properties of the heme cavity . these features are unusual for most heme_proteins , but common for heme - based CO sensors . two luminescent coordination_polymers were constructed with a fluorescent ligand . the emissions of these compounds could_be effectively and selectively quenched by acetone , showing their potential as acetone sensors . the formation of a coordination_polymer structure is proven to be responsible for their strong emission and sensing properties . we_have identified a ligand ( CO ) accommodation cavity in the signal transducer sensor protein HemAT ( heme - based aerotactic transducer ) that allows_us to gain single - molecule insights into the mechanism of gas_sensor proteins . specific mutations that are distal and proximal to the herne were designed to perturb the electrostatic field near the ligand that is bound to the heme and near the accommodated ligand in the cavity . we_report the detection of a second site in herne proteins in which the exogenous ligand is accommodated in an internal cavity . the conformational gate that directs the ligand - migration pathway from the distal to the proximal site of the heme , where the ligand is trapped , has_been identified . the data provide_evidence that the heme_pocket is the specific ligand trap and suggest_that the regulatory mechanism may_be tackled starting from more than one position in the protein . based on the results , we_propose a dynamic coupling between the two_distinct binding_sites as the underlying allosteric mechanism for gas recognition / discrimination that triggers a conformational switch for signaling by the oxygen sensor protein HemAT . electronic sensors capable of capturing mechanical deformation are highly_desirable for the next_generation of artificial_intelligence products . however , it remains a challenge to prepare self - healing , highly_sensitive , and cost - efficient sensors for both tiny and large human motion monitoring . here , a new_kind of self - healing , sensitive , and versatile strain sensors has_been developed by combining metal - ligand chemistry with hierarchical structure design . specifically , a self - healing and nanostructured conductive layer is deposited_onto a self - healing elastomer substrate cross-linked by metal - ligand coordinate bonds , forming a hierarchically_structured sensor . the resultant sensors exhibit high sensitivity , low detection_limit ( <nUm> % strain ) , remarkable self - healing capability , as well as excellent_reproducibility . notably , the self - healed sensors are still capable to precisely capture not_only tiny physiological activities ( such as speech , swallowing , and coughing ) but also large human_motions ( finger and neck bending , touching ) . moreover , harsh treatments , including bending over <nUm> times and mechanical washing , could_not influence the sensitivity and stability of the self - healed sensors in human motion monitoring . this proposed strategy via alliance of metal - ligand chemistry and hierarchical structure design represents a general approach to manufacturing self - healing , robust sensors , and other electronic_devices . A modular ligand design allowed the assembly of four phosphorus - supported pyrene - containing ligands . the number of pyrene arms could_be varied from <nUm> to <nUm> depending on the phosphorus support . while ligands containing one and three pyrene arms are excellent fluorescence - based sensors of Cu2+ , the ligand containing two pyrene arms shows a high specificity for Mg2+ .

In the presented work , a gold_nanoparticle ( GNP ) based optical sensor array was employed to classify and quantify seven toxic_metals ( arsenic , barium , cadmium , cerium , chromium , lead , and mercury ) . the sensor array receptors were GNPs functionalized by mercaptoundecanoic_acid , 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate , and a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of the two ligands . the mixed - ligand particle responds to the same analytes as the mono-ligand particles but in a distinctive way . this behavior demonstrates the high potential of mixed - ligand particles in the fabrication of sensor array receptors . the responses of the GNPs to different concentrations of the seven metal ions were analyzed , and a unique classification trajectory was produced for every metal . samples of different metal concentrations were then measured and identified using the classification trajectories . once sample composition has_been identified , a PLSR model , produced from the concatenated sensor array spectra of four calibration samples for each nanoparticle , was used to determine the metal concentration .

A symmetrical tetradentate_schiff base ligand was derived by the condensation of the corresponding o-vanillin with urea . the synthesized schiff_base ligand was studied to characterize its ability as a cation carrier in poly(vinylchloride) membrane solid contact sensor . the constructed sensor showed excellent response characteristics to iron_(III) ion . the electrode exhibited nernstian_slope of <nUm> mV / decade over a wide concentration range of iron_(III) from <nUm> x 10(-6) to <nUm> x 10(-2) m with a detection_limit of <nUm> x 10(-6) m . the sensor has fast_response time , good_reproducibility and excellent selectivity_toward iron_(III) ion with respect to many alkali , alkaline_earth , transition and heavy_metal ions . the potentiometric_response of the sensor is independent of pH of the test solution in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> . the applicability of the sensor was investigated by the determination of iron_(III) concentration in pharmaceutical , biological and water samples . heme - based oxygen sensors are part of ligand - specific two - component regulatory systems , which have both a relatively_low oxygen affinity and a low oxygen - binding rate . to get_insight into the dynamical_aspects underlying these features and the ligand specificity of the signal_transduction from the heme sensor domain , we used femtosecond spectroscopy to study ligand dynamics in the heme domains of the oxygen sensors FixL from bradyrhizobium japonicum ( FixLH ) and dos from escherichia_coli ( DosH ) . the heme coordination with different ligands and the corresponding ground - state heme spectra of FixLH are similar to myoglobin ( mb ) . after photodissociation , the excited - state properties and ligand - rebinding kinetics are qualitatively_similar for FixLH and mb for CO and NO as ligands . In contrast to mb , the transient spectra of FixLH after photodissociation of ligands are distorted compared with the ground - state difference spectra , indicating differences in the heme environment with respect to the unliganded state . this distortion is particularly marked for O(2) . strikingly , heme - O(2) recombination occurs with efficiency unprecedented for heme_proteins , in approximately <nUm> ps for approximately <nUm> % of the dissociated O(2) . for DosH - O(2) , which shows <nUm> % sequence similarity to FixLH , but where signal detection and transmission presumably are quite_different , a similarly fast recombination was found with an even higher yield . altogether these results_indicate that in these sensors the heme_pocket acts as a ligand - specific trap . the general implications for the functioning of heme - based ligand sensors are discussed in the light of recent_studies on heme - based NO and CO sensors . we_describe a biosensor that reports the binding of small - molecule ligands to proteins as changes in growth of temperature - sensitive yeast . the yeast_strains lack dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) and are complemented by mouse DHFR containing a ligand - binding domain inserted in a flexible loop . yeast_strains expressing two ligand - binding domain fusions , FKBP12 - DHFR and estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha)-DHFR , show increased growth in the presence of their corresponding ligands . we used this sensor to identify mutations in residues of ERalpha important for ligand binding , as well as mutations generally affecting protein activity or expression . we also tested the sensor against a chemical array to identify ligands that bind to FKBP12 or ERalpha . the ERalpha sensor was able to discriminate_among estrogen analogs , showing different_degrees of growth for the analogs that correlated with their relative binding_affinities ( RBAs ) . this growth assay provides a simple and inexpensive method to select novel ligands and ligand - binding domains .
